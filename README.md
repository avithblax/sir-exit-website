# Personal Website

This is a simple, modern personal website built with HTML and CSS. You can customize the content and styles in `index.html` to reflect your personality and portfolio.

2. Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".

### Using Python (if installed)

2. Run:
   - `python -m http.server 5500` (Python 3)
3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5500`
